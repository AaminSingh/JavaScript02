## OOP
-PROGRAMMING PARADYME: the structure of writing a code
-its style

## Object
- collection of properties(variables) and methods(functions)
- toLowerCase, toUpperCase, date

## why use OOP
- can use its features to avoid messiong up of code


## parts of OOP
Object literal


- Constructor function
- Prototypes

- Instances(new, this)

## 4 pillars
  Abstraction
  - Abstraction is a concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that hides complex implementation details and shows only the necessary features of an object.
  eg: fetch()

  Encapsulation
  - Encapsulation is the concept of hiding data and allowing access only through controlled methods. It helps protect data from unintended changes.

  Inheritance
  -Inheritance is a concept in object-oriented programming where a child class inherits properties and behaviors from a parent class. This promotes code reusability and avoids redundancy.

  Polymorphism
  - Polymorphism allows one interface to be used for different types of objects. It enables methods to have the same name but different behaviors based on the object calling them.
